### Task 6.2: Performance Validation ⏳ PENDING

#### Target Metrics:
- [ ] **Template-to-Site Generation Time: <30 minutes**
  - [ ] Implement performance monitoring in site generation
  - [ ] Create performance benchmarking tests
  - [ ] Optimize generation pipeline if needed

- [ ] **Page Load Times: <3 seconds**
  - [ ] Test homepage load performance
  - [ ] Validate builder interface load time
  - [ ] Measure template gallery performance
  - [ ] Implement Core Web Vitals monitoring

- [ ] **Memory and Resource Usage**
  - [ ] Monitor browser memory usage during builder operations
  - [ ] Test with large component trees
  - [ ] Validate performance on low-end devices

#### Implementation Steps:
```bash
# 1. Create performance monitoring utilities
touch src/lib/performance/monitor.ts
touch src/lib/performance/metrics.ts

# 2. Add performance tests
touch tests/e2e/performance-validation.spec.ts

# 3. Create benchmark scripts
touch scripts/performance-benchmark.js
```

### Task 6.3: Deployment Validation ⏳ PENDING

#### Target: 95% Deployment Success Rate

- [ ] **Static Site Generation Testing**
  - [ ] Test site generation with various component combinations
  - [ ] Validate asset optimization and compression
  - [ ] Test SEO metadata generation
  - [ ] Verify responsive CSS generation

- [ ] **Deployment Pipeline Testing**
  - [ ] Test Vercel API integration
  - [ ] Validate custom domain configuration
  - [ ] Test SSL certificate setup
  - [ ] Monitor deployment success rates

- [ ] **Error Handling and Recovery**
  - [ ] Test network failure scenarios
  - [ ] Validate error reporting and recovery
  - [ ] Test rollback mechanisms

## 🔧 Immediate Action Items

### 1. Fix Development Environment (Priority: HIGH)

```bash
# Navigate to web-builder directory
cd web-builder

# Check for port conflicts
netstat -an | findstr :3000
netstat -an | findstr :3003

# Update package.json dev script if needed
# OR update Playwright config to use port 3003

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 2. Update Test Configuration

```typescript
// Update playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  // ... existing config
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3003', // Update from 3000 to 3003
    // ... rest of config
  },
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run dev',
    url: 'http://localhost:3003', // Update from 3000 to 3003
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
  },
});
```

### 3. Execute MVP Test Suite

```bash
# Run the comprehensive MVP test suite
node run-mvp-tests.js

# Or run individual test categories
npx playwright test tests/e2e/mvp-user-journey.spec.ts
npx playwright test --grep "Performance"
npx playwright test --project="Mobile Chrome"
```

### 4. Create Performance Monitoring

```typescript
// src/lib/performance/monitor.ts
export class PerformanceMonitor {
  static startTiming(label: string): void;
  static endTiming(label: string): number;
  static measureCoreWebVitals(): Promise<CoreWebVitals>;
  static trackSiteGeneration(components: ComponentData[]): Promise<GenerationMetrics>;
}
```

### 5. Implement Deployment Validation

```typescript
// src/lib/deployment/validator.ts
export class DeploymentValidator {
  static validateSiteGeneration(site: GeneratedSite): ValidationResult;
  static testDeploymentPipeline(): Promise<DeploymentResult>;
  static monitorSuccessRate(): Promise<SuccessRateMetrics>;
}
```

## 📊 Success Criteria

### MVP Ready for Launch When:
- [ ] All E2E user journey tests pass (100% success rate)
- [ ] Site generation completes in <30 minutes for standard templates
- [ ] Page load times consistently <3 seconds
- [ ] Deployment success rate >95%
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness validated across devices
- [ ] SEO scores >85/100
- [ ] Performance budgets met
- [ ] Error handling gracefully manages edge cases

## 🚀 Next Steps After Testing

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Address any performance bottlenecks found
   - Optimize critical rendering paths
   - Implement lazy loading where beneficial

2. **User Experience Refinement**
   - Fix any UX issues discovered in testing
   - Improve error messages and user feedback
   - Enhance accessibility features

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Set up production environment
   - Configure monitoring and analytics
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline
   - Plan rollout strategy

## 📝 Documentation Requirements

- [ ] Test execution reports
- [ ] Performance benchmark results
- [ ] Deployment validation results
- [ ] User acceptance criteria validation
- [ ] Known issues and limitations
- [ ] Production readiness checklist

## ⚠️ Current Blockers

1. **Development Server Port Issue**
   - Server attempting to start on port 3003 instead of 3000
   - Tests configured for port 3000
   - Need to align configuration

2. **Test Environment Setup**
   - Ensure all dependencies are installed
   - Verify Playwright browsers are installed
   - Check test data and fixtures

## 💡 Recommendations

1. **Immediate Focus**: Fix development server startup to enable test execution
2. **Parallel Work**: Create performance monitoring utilities while fixing server
3. **Testing Strategy**: Start with smoke tests, then comprehensive user journeys
4. **Documentation**: Record all test results for production readiness assessment
