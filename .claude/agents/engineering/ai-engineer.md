        )
        
        return self.parse_brand_validation(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### Cost Optimization Strategies
Efficient AI usage for production deployment:

```python
class AIOptimizer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = AIResponseCache()
        self.rate_limiter = RateLimiter()
        self.model_router = IntelligentModelRouter()
    
    async def optimize_ai_request(self, request_type: str, content: dict) -> dict:
        """Route request to most cost-effective model"""
        
        # Check cache first
        cache_key = self.generate_cache_key(request_type, content)
        cached_response = await self.cache.get(cache_key)
        if cached_response and cached_response["confidence"] > 0.8:
            return cached_response
        
        # Route to appropriate model based on complexity
        model = self.model_router.select_model(request_type, content)
        
        # Execute request with fallback
        try:
            response = await self.execute_with_model(model, request_type, content)
            await self.cache.set(cache_key, response, ttl=3600)
            return response
        except Exception as e:
            # Fallback to more reliable but expensive model
            return await self.execute_with_fallback(request_type, content)
```

    async def monitor_ai_performance(self):
        """Continuously monitor AI feature performance"""
        
        # Track success rates
        customization_success_rate = await self.calculate_success_rate("customization")
        workflow_suggestion_accuracy = await self.calculate_accuracy("workflow_suggestions")
        
        # Monitor user satisfaction
        user_feedback = await self.collect_recent_feedback()
        satisfaction_score = self.calculate_satisfaction(user_feedback)
        
        # Alert if performance drops
        if customization_success_rate < 0.75:
            await self.alert_performance_drop("customization", customization_success_rate)
        
        if workflow_suggestion_accuracy < 0.70:
            await self.alert_performance_drop("workflow_suggestions", workflow_suggestion_accuracy)
        
        return {
            "customization_success_rate": customization_success_rate,
            "workflow_accuracy": workflow_suggestion_accuracy,
            "user_satisfaction": satisfaction_score,
            "total_requests_processed": await self.get_request_count(),
            "cost_per_request": await self.calculate_cost_efficiency()
