## 🚀 Quick Start: Deploy Your Teams

### Option 1: Complete Team Deployment (Recommended)
```bash
claude "I need you to orchestrate the AI Marketing Web Builder Platform development project. Here are the details:

Project Path: /mnt/d/Tmux/AI-Marketing-Web-Builder/spec
Teams to create: frontend, backend, ai-services, integration

This is a unified platform that combines:
- Professional drag-and-drop web builder (competing with Simvoly)
- AI component customization (v0-style editing)
- Built-in workflow automation (competing with GoHighLevel)
- The 'Magic Connector' that links components to workflows instantly

Please read all specification files and coordinate development teams according to the 4-month MVP plan. Each team should work autonomously while following their detailed specs.

Start by:
1. Reading all spec files to understand the unified platform vision
2. Creating tmux sessions for each team
3. Briefing each team on the 'Magic Moment' user experience
4. Setting up coordination protocols for the integrated platform
5. Beginning Phase 1 development (Core Builder + Smart Templates)

Focus on the critical differentiators:
- 30+ premium templates with drag-drop builder
- v0-style AI component customization
- n8n-style visual workflow builder
- Component-to-workflow connection system ('Magic Connector')
- Built-in CRM with email automation

Proceed with full autonomy after initial setup. Use the send-claude-message.sh script for all team communication."
```

### Option 2: Gradual Team Deployment
Start with core teams first, then expand:

#### Step 1: Frontend + Backend Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
```bash
claude "Deploy frontend and backend teams for the AI Marketing Web Builder Platform.

Project Path: /mnt/d/Tmux/AI-Marketing-Web-Builder/spec
Teams: frontend, backend

Focus on the unified platform foundation:
- Frontend: Drag-drop builder with 30+ premium templates
- Backend: Template system + basic workflow engine + CRM foundation

This is competing with both Simvoly (beautiful builder) and GoHighLevel (workflow automation) by combining both in one platform.

Read frontend-spec.md and backend-spec.md for detailed 4-month sprint plans."
```

#### Step 2: Add AI Team (Week 3)
```bash
# After builder foundation is working
claude "Add AI team to the AI Marketing Web Builder Platform project.

Project Path: /mnt/d/Tmux/AI-Marketing-Web-Builder/spec
New Team: ai-services

The frontend and backend teams are building the foundation. AI team should focus on:
- v0-style component customization with natural language
- AI workflow suggestions for component-workflow connections
- The 'Magic Connector' that analyzes components and suggests automations

This is the key differentiator - AI that bridges beautiful design with powerful automation.

Read ai-spec.md for detailed AI service specifications."
```

#### Step 3: Add Integration Team (Week 4)
```bash
# After core platform is working
claude "Add integration team to coordinate the unified platform.

Project Path: /mnt/d/Tmux/AI-Marketing-Web-Builder/spec
New Team: integration

Focus on the 'Magic Moment' user experience:
- Template selection → AI customization → Workflow connection → Live site
- End-to-end testing of the complete user journey
- Performance testing for drag-drop + AI + workflows

Read integration-spec.md for detailed coordination requirements."
