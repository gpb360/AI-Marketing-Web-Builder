# Enhanced Agent Workflows with GitHub Project Integration

## üîÑ **MANDATORY GITHUB PROJECT WORKFLOW**

All agents must follow this enhanced workflow that includes GitHub Project tracking at every step. This prevents orphaned components and ensures complete visibility.

### **üìã GitHub Project Boards**
- **Frontend Project #10**: https://github.com/users/gpb360/projects/10
- **Backend Project #11**: https://github.com/users/gpb360/projects/11  
- **Design Project #12**: https://github.com/users/gpb360/projects/12

## üö® **UPDATED AGENT ISOLATION WORKFLOW (MANDATORY)**

**EVERY AGENT** must follow this exact protocol - no exceptions:

```
1. CHECK GitHub Project board assigned to your agent type
2. PICK available task from Ready column matching your domain
3. VERIFY task is linked to GitHub issue with acceptance criteria  
4. CREATE ISOLATED branch: {agent-type}/{agent-name}/{feature-description}
5. MOVE task to "In Progress" + add assigned:{agent-name} label
6. WORK ONLY on files within your agent domain (see File Ownership Matrix)
7. CODE + commit + push to isolated branch
8. CREATE PR with agent prefix: "[{AGENT-NAME}] Task Title"
9. LINK PR to GitHub issue in PR description: "Closes #issue-number"
10. MOVE task to "Ready for Review" column
11. WAIT for Lead Dev review (5min max) + merge
12. Lead Dev moves task to "Done" column automatically
```

**CRITICAL**: Each agent MUST link PRs to GitHub issues for complete traceability

### **üìä Task Selection Protocol**

#### **1. Check Your Project Board**
Before starting ANY work:
```bash
# Frontend agents check:
gh project list --owner gpb360  # Verify project #10

# Backend agents check:  
gh project list --owner gpb360  # Verify project #11

# Design agents check:
gh project list --owner gpb360  # Verify project #12
```

#### **2. Select Task from Ready Column**
- **Frontend agents**: Only pick tasks from Frontend Project #10 Ready column
- **Backend agents**: Only pick tasks from Backend Project #11 Ready column  
- **Design agents**: Only pick tasks from Design Project #12 Ready column
- **Integration agents**: Pick from Frontend Project #10 (integration tasks default here)

#### **3. Verify Task Completeness**
Every task must have:
- ‚úÖ Clear title with story number (e.g., "Story 3.2: Create SmartTemplateSelector")
- ‚úÖ Detailed description with acceptance criteria
- ‚úÖ Proper labels (story-X.X, frontend/backend/design)
- ‚úÖ Estimated duration and complexity
- ‚úÖ Agent assignment guidance
