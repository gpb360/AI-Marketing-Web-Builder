## 🔧 Configuration

### SLA Thresholds
```yaml
pr_review_time: 300 seconds      # 5 minutes
build_time: 600 seconds          # 10 minutes  
test_execution: 480 seconds      # 8 minutes
deployment_time: 900 seconds     # 15 minutes
agent_response: 120 seconds      # 2 minutes
task_completion: 14400 seconds   # 4 hours
```

### Workflow Triggers
- **GitHub Events**: PR created, merged, build failed
- **Schedule**: Cron-based scheduling with interval support  
- **SLA Violations**: Automatic trigger on threshold breaches
- **Agent Events**: Agent idle, task completion, errors
- **Manual**: User-initiated workflow execution

### Action Types
- **Notifications**: Slack, email, GitHub comments
- **GitHub Operations**: Create issues, assign reviewers, merge PRs
- **Status Updates**: Update PR/issue status, labels, milestones
- **Escalations**: Multi-level SLA violation escalation
- **Agent Actions**: Notify agents, redistribute tasks

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

### Real-time Dashboards
- **Workflow Performance**: Success rates, execution times, failure analysis
- **SLA Compliance**: Current status, violation trends, escalation metrics
- **Agent Productivity**: Activity levels, task completion rates, isolation compliance
- **GitHub Integration**: PR metrics, build performance, deployment success

### Performance Metrics
- **Workflow Success Rate**: Target >95%
- **Average Execution Time**: Track and optimize workflow performance
- **SLA Compliance**: Monitor adherence to defined thresholds
- **Agent Utilization**: Ensure balanced workload distribution

## 🚨 SLA Violations & Escalations

### Level 1: Warning (5-10 minutes)
- Automated notification to responsible party
- Update GitHub status with warning indication
- Log violation for trend analysis

### Level 2: Escalation (10-15 minutes)
- Notify team leads and managers
- Create GitHub issue for tracking
- Trigger automated recovery actions

### Level 3: Critical (15+ minutes)
- Page on-call engineer
- Escalate to senior management  
- Activate emergency response procedures

## 🤖 Agent Integration

### Agent Activity Tracking
```python
# Track agent activities for SLA monitoring
activity = AgentActivity(
    agent_name="frontend-developer",
    agent_type="engineering",
    activity_type="pr_review",
    activity_data={
        "pr_number": 123,
        "review_type": "code_quality",
        "files_reviewed": 15
    },
    repository="AI-Marketing-Web-Builder",
    branch_name="feature/epic-2-automation"
)
```

### Branch Isolation Monitoring
- Monitor compliance with agent branch naming conventions
- Detect and prevent merge conflicts through isolation
- Report on agent coordination effectiveness

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

### API Key Management
- Environment-based configuration for all secrets
- No hardcoded keys in repository
- Secure token handling for GitHub integration

### Access Control  
- Role-based access to workflow management
- Audit logging for all automation actions
- Secure webhook endpoints with validation
