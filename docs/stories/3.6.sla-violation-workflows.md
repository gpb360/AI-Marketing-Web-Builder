2. Escalation matrix: Level 1 auto-fix → Level 2 team notification → Level 3 critical alert with executive escalation
3. Integration with existing workflow engine for remediation actions using current drag-drop builder
4. Success/failure tracking for remediation attempts with learning-based improvement
5. Manual override capability for all automated actions with audit logging and rollback
6. Machine learning-powered root cause analysis with predictive remediation suggestions
7. Integration with external systems (GitHub, Slack, PagerDuty) for comprehensive incident response

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Building directly on Phase 1's SLA monitoring infrastructure and Phase 2's predictive SLA prevention. The established SLA violation detection (SLADashboard.tsx) and workflow engine provide the foundation for automated remediation with intelligent escalation.

### Technical Architecture Context
**Source**: ARCHITECTURE.md - Remediation workflows integrate with existing workflow engine (`backend/app/services/workflow_service.py`) and SLA monitoring system, extending current violation handling with automated response capabilities.

### Data Models and API Specifications

**Remediation Workflow Configuration** [Source: existing SLA violation structure and workflow engine]:
```typescript
interface SLARemediationWorkflow {
  violation_type: SLAViolationType;  // From existing VIOLATION_TYPES
  remediation_strategy: RemediationStrategy;
  escalation_matrix: EscalationLevel[];
  success_criteria: RemediationSuccessCriteria;
  rollback_conditions: RollbackTrigger[];
  integration_configs: ExternalIntegrationConfig[];
}

interface RemediationStrategy {
  strategy_id: string;
  strategy_name: string;
  automation_level: 'fully_automated' | 'semi_automated' | 'manual_approval';
  actions: RemediationAction[];
  success_rate: number;  // Historical success rate
  avg_resolution_time: number;  // Average time to resolution
  risk_level: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
}

interface EscalationLevel {
  level: 1 | 2 | 3;
  trigger_conditions: EscalationTrigger[];
  actions: EscalationAction[];
  timeout_minutes: number;
  notification_targets: NotificationTarget[];
  approval_required: boolean;
}
```

**ML-Powered Root Cause Analysis**:
```typescript
interface RootCauseAnalysis {
  violation_id: string;
  primary_cause: {
    category: 'infrastructure' | 'code' | 'external_dependency' | 'configuration';
    confidence: number;  // 0.0 to 1.0
    evidence: AnalysisEvidence[];
  };
  contributing_factors: ContributingFactor[];
  similar_incidents: SimilarIncident[];
  recommended_remediation: RemediationRecommendation[];
  prevention_suggestions: PreventionSuggestion[];
}
```

**Integration with Existing Systems** [Source: SLADashboard.tsx and workflow infrastructure]:
- SLA violation types (lines 44-51): pr_review_time, build_time, test_execution, deployment_time
- Level configuration (lines 53-57) for escalation mapping
- Quick action system (lines 85-114) for manual remediation triggers
- Existing workflow engine for remediation workflow execution

### Intelligent Remediation Engine

```python
class SLARemediationService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root_cause_analyzer = MLRootCauseAnalyzer()
        self.strategy_optimizer = RemediationStrategyOptimizer()
        self.escalation_engine = IntelligentEscalationEngine()
        self.external_integrations = ExternalSystemManager()
        
    def analyze_violation_and_remediate(self, 
                                      violation: SLAViolation) -> RemediationExecution:
        # ML-powered root cause analysis
        root_cause = self.root_cause_analyzer.analyze(violation)
        
        # Strategy selection based on cause and historical success
        strategy = self.strategy_optimizer.select_optimal_strategy(
            violation_type=violation.violation_type,
            root_cause=root_cause,
            system_state=self.get_current_system_state()
        )
        
        # Execute remediation with monitoring
        return self.execute_remediation_strategy(strategy, violation)
        
    def learn_from_remediation(self, 
                             remediation_result: RemediationResult):
        # Update ML models based on success/failure outcomes
        # Optimize strategy selection for similar future violations
        # Improve root cause analysis accuracy
```

**Root Cause Analysis ML Pipeline**:
```python
class MLRootCauseAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.feature_extractor = ViolationFeatureExtractor()
        self.classification_model = RandomForestClassifier()
        self.similarity_engine = VectorSimilarityEngine()
        
    def analyze(self, violation: SLAViolation) -> RootCauseAnalysis:
        # Extract features from violation context
        features = self.feature_extractor.extract_features(violation)
        
        # Classify root cause category
        primary_cause = self.classification_model.predict_proba(features)
        
        # Find similar historical incidents
        similar_incidents = self.similarity_engine.find_similar(violation)
        
        # Generate evidence and recommendations
        return self.compile_analysis_report(primary_cause, similar_incidents, features)
```
