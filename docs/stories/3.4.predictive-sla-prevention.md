## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Building on existing SLA monitoring infrastructure from Epic 2, including SLADashboard component and violation tracking system. The established SLA violation structure provides the foundation for prediction modeling.

### Technical Architecture Context
**Source**: ARCHITECTURE.md - Backend services will host ML prediction models with FastAPI endpoints, frontend dashboard enhancements via existing SLA monitoring UI.

### Data Models and API Specifications

**ML Model Input Structure** [Source: backend/app/models/workflow.py and SLADashboard.tsx:18-30]:
```python
class SLAPredictionFeatures:
    workflow_id: int
    violation_type: str  # pr_review_time, build_time, test_execution, etc.
    historical_performance: List[float]  # Last 30 days performance data
    current_load: float
    time_of_day: int
    day_of_week: int
    recent_violations: int
    system_resources: Dict[str, float]
```

**Prediction API Response**:
```typescript
interface SLAPrediction {
  violation_type: string;
  probability: number;  // 0.0 to 1.0
  confidence_score: number;  // Model confidence in prediction
  predicted_time: string;  // ISO timestamp of predicted violation
  recommended_actions: ActionRecommendation[];
  historical_accuracy: number;  // Model accuracy for this prediction type
}
```

**Existing Integration Points** [Source: SLADashboard.tsx]:
- SLA violation types (lines 44-51): pr_review_time, build_time, test_execution, deployment_time, agent_response, task_completion
- Level configuration (lines 53-57) for escalation integration
- Quick action system (lines 85-114) for remediation triggers

### Component Specifications

**Frontend Components to Enhance** [Source: web-builder/src/components/builder/]:
```typescript
// Extend existing SLADashboard.tsx
interface PredictionCardProps {
  prediction: SLAPrediction;
  onTakeAction: (action: string) => void;
  onDismiss: () => void;
}

// New prediction components
- PredictionCard extends existing Card pattern
- PredictionTimeline for forecast visualization  
- ModelPerformanceChart for accuracy tracking
- RecommendedActionsPanel for suggested remediations
```

### Machine Learning Implementation

**ML Technology Stack**:
- **Framework**: scikit-learn for classification, Prophet/ARIMA for time-series forecasting
- **Features**: Historical violation patterns, system metrics, temporal features
- **Model Type**: Ensemble of Random Forest (classification) + Prophet (time-series)
- **Training**: Automated retraining every 7 days with accuracy validation
- **Storage**: Model artifacts in /backend/ml_models/ with versioning

**Prediction Pipeline** [Source: existing workflow_service.py patterns]:
```python
# Integration with existing WorkflowService
class SLAPredictionService:
    def predict_violations(self, workflow_id: int) -> List[SLAPrediction]:
        # Use existing WorkflowService data for features
        # Return predictions with confidence scores
    
    def get_model_accuracy(self) -> Dict[str, float]:
        # Track prediction accuracy by violation type
        
    def retrain_model(self, feedback_data: List[PredictionFeedback]):
        # Automated model retraining with new data
```

### Alert System Integration

**Multi-Channel Alerting** [Source: existing SLA monitoring patterns]:
- **Email**: SMTP integration with templated prediction warnings
- **Webhook**: POST to configured URLs for external system integration  
- **Dashboard**: Real-time UI notifications via WebSocket
- **Slack/Teams**: Optional integration via webhook patterns

**Alert Suppression Logic**:
- Rate limiting: Max 1 alert per violation type per 30 minutes
- Confidence threshold: Only alert on predictions >70% confidence
- Business hours: Configurable alerting schedules
- Escalation: Auto-escalate if prediction becomes violation

### Auto-scaling Integration

**Scaling Decision Engine**:
- **Capacity Predictions**: CPU, memory, database connection forecasting
- **Scaling Triggers**: Predicted resource exhaustion within 15 minutes
- **Manual Override**: Admin dashboard controls for scaling approval
- **Rollback**: Automatic scaling reversal if predictions prove incorrect
