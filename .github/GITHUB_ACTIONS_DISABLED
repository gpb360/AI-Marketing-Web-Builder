# GitHub Actions Disabled

This repository has GitHub Actions intentionally disabled due to account limitations.

## What this means:
- No CI/CD workflows will run automatically
- No automated testing on push/PR
- No automated deployments
- No scheduled workflows

## Alternative development workflow:
1. Run tests locally: `npm test`
2. Run type checking: `npm run type-check`
3. Run linting: `npm run lint`
4. Manual deployment when needed

## If you need to enable actions later:
1. Remove the `.github/workflows/disabled.yml` file
2. Delete this `GITHUB_ACTIONS_DISABLED` file
3. Add your actual workflow files to `.github/workflows/`

Date disabled: 2025-01-29
Reason: Account limitations - GitHub Actions not available
