# BMad Development Protocol - Complete Workflow Management

## üö® CRITICAL: GitHub MCP Usage Rule

**NEVER USE GITHUB API DIRECTLY - ALWAYS USE GITHUB MCP TOOLS**

```bash
# ‚ùå WRONG - Will always fail with 401 errors
GET https://api.github.com/repos/...

# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Use GitHub MCP tools exclusively
mcp__github__get_pull_request(owner="gpb360", repo="AI-Marketing-Web-Builder", pullNumber=132)
mcp__github__list_pull_requests(owner="gpb360", repo="AI-Marketing-Web-Builder")
mcp__github__create_pull_request(...)
```

**This rule is MANDATORY and applies 100% of the time. No exceptions.**

## üéØ Pre-Work Protocol - Branch Management First

### RULE: Before Any Work Starts

**MANDATORY SEQUENCE - Execute in this exact order:**

1. **Check Current Branch Status**
   ```bash
   git status                    # Verify current branch
   git log --oneline -5         # See recent commits
   ```

2. **Process Review Column Tasks**
   - Get all tasks in "Review" status from Archon
   - **REQUIREMENT**: Every Review task MUST have a corresponding PR
   - If Review task has no PR ‚Üí Create PR immediately
   - If Review task has PR ‚Üí Process the PR review

3. **Process Existing PRs** 
   ```bash
   # Use GitHub MCP tools ONLY
   mcp__github__list_pull_requests(owner="gpb360", repo="AI-Marketing-Web-Builder", state="open")
   ```

4. **Create New Branch from Main**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b feature/task-{archon-id}-{description}
   git push -u origin feature/task-{archon-id}-{description}
   ```

5. **Only Then Begin New Task Work**

## üìã Review-to-PR Mapping Requirements

### Mandatory PR Creation Rules

**ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT**: No task can be in "Review" status without a corresponding PR.

```bash
# When moving task to "Review" status:
archon:manage_task(
  action="update",
  task_id="task-123",
  update_fields={
    "status": "review",
    "pr_url": "https://github.com/gpb360/AI-Marketing-Web-Builder/pull/133"
  }
)
```

### PR Creation Process
1. **Create Feature Branch** (if not exists)
2. **Push All Changes**
3. **Create PR via GitHub MCP**:
   ```bash
   mcp__github__create_pull_request(
     owner="gpb360",
     repo="AI-Marketing-Web-Builder", 
     title="[TASK-ID] Feature Description",
     head="feature/task-{id}-{desc}",
     base="main",
     body="Completes Archon task {task-id}\n\n{detailed description}"
   )
   ```
4. **Update Archon Task** with PR URL
5. **Set Status to Review**

## üîç PR Review Categorization System

### Mandatory Review Categories

Every PR review MUST categorize ALL findings into these buckets:

#### 1. **Nice to Have Future Development**
- **Action**: Document in backlog for future sprints
- **Examples**: Performance optimizations, UX enhancements, additional features
- **Decision**: Approve PR, create future tasks

#### 2. **Must Haves Future Add-ons**  
- **Action**: Create high-priority Archon tasks immediately
- **Examples**: Security improvements, scalability requirements, critical missing features
- **Decision**: Approve PR, schedule high-priority follow-up

#### 3. **Current Blocker Fix Now**
- **Action**: DO NOT MERGE - Fix in current branch immediately
- **Examples**: Build failures, test failures, critical bugs, security vulnerabilities
- **Decision**: Request changes, block merge until fixed

#### 4. **Not Needed Move On**
- **Action**: Document reasoning and proceed with merge
- **Examples**: Over-engineering suggestions, out-of-scope improvements
- **Decision**: Approve PR, document why suggestions were declined

#### 5. **Should Be Refactored - Technical Debt**
- **Action**: Approve merge but create refactoring task
- **Examples**: Code duplication, complex functions, missing abstractions
- **Decision**: Merge now, add to technical debt backlog

### Review Documentation Template

```markdown
## PR Review Categorization

### Nice to Have Future Development
- [ ] Performance optimization for large datasets
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for power users

### Must Haves Future Add-ons
- [ ] Input validation for user-generated content
- [ ] Error boundary implementation

### Current Blocker Fix Now
- [ ] ‚ùå Build failing due to TypeScript errors
- [ ] ‚ùå Tests not passing in CI

### Not Needed Move On
- [ ] Suggested design patterns don't fit current architecture
- [ ] Over-optimization for edge cases

### Should Be Refactored - Technical Debt
- [ ] Extract common utility functions
- [ ] Simplify complex conditional logic

**Decision**: [Approve/Request Changes/Needs Work]
**Reasoning**: [Detailed explanation]
```

## üîí Main Branch Protection Protocol

### Absolute Requirements

**Main branch MUST remain error-free and deployable at all times.**

#### Pre-Merge Verification
1. **All CI checks pass** (build, test, lint)
2. **Manual functionality test** completed
3. **No merge conflicts** with main
4. **Review categorization** completed
5. **All blockers resolved**

#### Post-Merge Verification
```bash
# Immediately after merge - verify main is healthy
git checkout main
git pull origin main
npm run build                # Frontend must build
cd backend && make dev      # Backend must start
npm run test:critical       # Critical tests must pass
```

#### Rollback Protocol
If main becomes broken:
1. **STOP all development** on feature branches
2. **Identify breaking commit**: `git log --oneline`
3. **Create emergency hotfix** from last good commit
4. **Implement minimal fix**
5. **Emergency merge** after testing
6. **All agents rebase** feature branches on fixed main

## üîÑ Parallel Agent Coordination

### Conflict Prevention Rules

1. **Claim Tasks Early**: Update Archon task to "doing" status immediately
2. **Separate Branches**: Each agent works on own feature branch
3. **Coordinate on Shared Files**: Use Archon task comments for communication
4. **Merge Priority**: Highest `task_order` gets merge priority

### Parallel Work Process

```bash
# Agent 1 working on task-abc
git checkout -b feature/task-abc-auth-system

# Agent 2 working on task-def  
git checkout -b feature/task-def-payment-flow

# Both can work simultaneously without conflicts
# Merge coordination happens at PR level
```

### Merge Coordination
1. **Higher priority task merges first** (task_order)
2. **Other agents rebase** their branches on updated main
3. **Resolve conflicts** in feature branches before new PR
4. **Full test suite** runs after each merge to main

## üé≠ Enhanced BMad Development Phases (From PR #132)

### Phase-Based Quality Gates
Based on `bmad-testing-config.json` enhancements:

```

mcp__playwright__browser_type(element="Project name input", ref="input-456", text="Test Site")
mcp__playwright__browser_select_option(element="Template dropdown", ref="select-789", values=["saas-pro"])

# Validation and testing
